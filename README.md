# BattleShip Game 

BattleShip is played on ruled grids on which each player's fleet of warships are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. The game consists of the following types of ships: 
<square> Carrier: 5 
<square> Battleship: 4 
<square> Cruiser: 3 
<square> Destroyer: 2 

Players alternate turns calling shots at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet. When all of the squares of a ship have been hit, the corresponding ship has sunk. The first player to sink two of the opponent's ships, wins the game.
